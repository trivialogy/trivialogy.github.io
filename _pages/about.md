Hello there! First and foremost, thanks for checking in... This place exists just for me to doxx myself!

I am an undergraduate student at a rather unremarkable university in Hong Kong, reading mathematics. I have to admit though my mathematical abilities are indeed subpar, I am chipping my to-do list away albeit extremely slowly. I had attended school in Hong Kong and in the United Kingdom.

As suggested in the name, **trivialogy** is the study of trivial matters. I will post very irregularly here, about my poor life choices and my backwards studies, but I assume everybody is already thinking way ahead of me. You can watch me struggle with basic algebra, that may provide some entertainment value. Alas, my favourite word is [schadenfreude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude "(noun) pleasure derived from the misfortunes of others"), so it is only fitting.

Peace out!
