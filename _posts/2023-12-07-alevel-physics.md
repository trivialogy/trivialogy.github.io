I took the OCR Physics A (H556) A-Level syllabus some time ago, and have compiled some notes which I think could be beneficial to any student regardless of exam board. Feel free to contact and correct me if I got anything wrong. Since AS topics are indisputably trivial, I only have notes of A2 modules prepared, which cover the following:

- Module 5: Newtonian World and Astrophysics ([download here](/assets/downloads/m5_newton.pdf))
  - Thermal Physics
  - Circular Motion
  - Oscillations
  - Gravitaional Fields
  - Astrophysics and Cosmology
- Module 6: Particles and Medical Physics ([download here](/assets/downloads/m6_e&m.pdf))
  - Capacitors
  - Electric Fields
  - Electromagnetism
  - Nuclear and Particle Physics
  - Medical Imaging
  
I am releasing these instead of letting these go to waste. Enjoy!
